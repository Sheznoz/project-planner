# Project Treatment

## Brief
A web-app for project management. A place to take notes periodically, tied to trunks. Timeline a project and its deliverables. Allow for more granular
approach to each feature. MVP and finished product stages of in the timeline. Oriented around trunk based development workflow. Milestones will be a collection of
trunks. Integration with Github to track branches, PRs (maybe even commits?), and the like. Support for teams, so some basic user management and auth will be in order.
A kanban board view available for milestones. Allow for flexible changing of trunk or milestones requirements.
